## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Tailwind
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project i learned how to use 2 images at the same time by using css "background-image" propriety, and also learned how to position an image above its container by using css "translate" propriety.

### Continued development

I need to get more used to tailwind css.

### Useful resources

-   [Tailwind - Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This documentation was my guide during all the project.
-   [kelvinappiah - Profile card solution](https://github.com/kelvinappiah/Profile-card/blob/main/styles.css) - It was from this CSS code that I took the solution for the background.

## Acknowledgments

It was my first time dealing with 2 images in the background. At first I didn't know it was possible so I tried approaches with absolute divs or putting the images as background in the header and footer, but none of this gave good results. After spending quite a bit of time failing to solve it I started looking for topics on Stakoverflow. I managed to get pretty close to the result, but it was still a little different. Looking for another way to get to the perfect result I came up with the user [kelvinappiah](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/kelvinappiah) solution. With a few small changes it worked perfectly in my code.
